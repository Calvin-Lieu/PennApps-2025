# Google Earth Engine Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your project ID

# Your Google Cloud Project ID (optional but recommended)
# Get this from: https://console.cloud.google.com/
# This is only needed if you want to use a specific project
EE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here

# Note: You don't need a .env file for basic Earth Engine usage
# The .env file is only needed if you want to specify a specific project
# 
# To get your project ID:
# 1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
# 2. Select or create a project
# 3. Copy the project ID from the project selector dropdown
# 4. Paste it above replacing 'your-project-id-here'
#
# If you don't have a Google Cloud project, you can still use Earth Engine
# without specifying a project ID - just leave this file as is or don't create .env
