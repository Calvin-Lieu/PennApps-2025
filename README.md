# PennApps 2025: ShadeNav

![ShadeNav Demo](figs/hackathon7.png)

Climate change has created a devastating feedback loop: rising temperatures make walking unbearable, forcing people to drive more, pumping more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, making cities even hotter.

**ShadeNav breaks this cycle** by making walking comfortable again through intelligent shade-optimized routing. Using satellite analysis and real-time sun positioning, we find paths that maximize shade coverage - because shaded areas feel up to 20Â°F cooler than direct sunlight.

A comprehensive route-planning system for downtown Philadelphia that optimizes paths based on shade coverage and essential services using advanced satellite imagery analysis and OpenStreetMap data.

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows
   # or
   source .venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up Google Earth Engine (for satellite data):**
   ```bash
   # Install Earth Engine API
   pip install earthengine-api
   
   # Authenticate (this will open a browser window)
   python -c "import ee; ee.Authenticate()"
   
   # Test authentication
   python -c "import ee; ee.Initialize(); print('Earth Engine working!')"
   ```

4. **Optional: Configure project settings:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .example.env .env
   
   # Edit .env and add your Google Cloud Project ID (optional)
   # This is only needed if you want to use a specific project
   ```

5. **Run tree detection:**
   ```bash
   python tree_detection.py
   ```

6. **Run waypoint pathfinding:**
   ```bash
   python waypoint_pathfinding.py
   ```

   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash

   ```

## Pre-generated Data

The backend includes pre-generated JSON files from running the detection systems:

- `tree_positions.json`: 703 detected trees with satellite analysis data
- `waypoints_data.json`: Essential services waypoint data

These files can be used immediately without running the detection algorithms.

## API Integration

The generated JSON files can be easily integrated with frontend applications:

```python
import json

# Load tree data
with open('tree_positions.json', 'r') as f:
    tree_data = json.load(f)

# Access trees
trees = tree_data['trees']
for tree in trees:
    lat, lon = tree['latitude'], tree['longitude']
    density = tree['density']
    source = tree['source']
```

## Development Process

### Developing the graph
![Visualization of roads in downtown Philadelphia](figs/philly_roads.png)

Initial street network extraction from OpenStreetMap showing downtown Philadelphia's road infrastructure. This visualization demonstrates the comprehensive coverage of walkable paths that form the foundation of our routing graph.

### Processing edge shadow data
![Generating shadow profiling for edges in graph](figs/hackathon2.png)

Shadow analysis pipeline in action, processing individual street segments (edges) to calculate shade coverage. The visualization shows the computational process of analyzing building heights and sun angles to determine shadow patterns for each walkable path.

### Profiling edges at different times of day

Temporal shadow analysis across different hours of the day, demonstrating how shade patterns shift as the sun moves. Each visualization captures shadow distribution at key times (morning, midday, afternoon, evening), showing the dynamic nature of urban shade coverage that drives our intelligent routing decisions.

### Comprehensive Shade Analysis
![Street-level shade profiling across temporal periods](figs/street_profiling.png)

Aggregated shade coverage analysis that combines temporal shadow data across all time periods to create comprehensive shade profiles for each street segment. This visualization represents the culmination of our shadow analysis pipeline, showing average shade coverage that enables optimal route planning throughout the day.

### Development Highlights

These are completed components that demonstrate core capabilities but are not yet fully integrated into the main ShadeNav system:

- **Tree Detection System**: Used the Google Earth Engine API with multi-spectral vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI, GNDVI) for precise tree location detection and size estimation, successfully identifying 700+ urban trees in downtown Philadelhia with geometric shadow computation and pathway intersection analysis.

The tree detection system uses Google Earth Engine API to process Sentinel-2 satellite imagery with NDVI, NDWI, and GNDVI vegetation indices at 5m resolution, creating a dense grid where each cell's vegetation density score serves as a proxy for tree size estimation. Once trees are detected and sized, the system performs geometric shadow computation using solar ray tracing algorithms that calculate shadow patterns based on sun position, tree height, and canopy geometry throughout the day. These computed tree shadows are then intersected with urban pathway networks using polygon-polyline intersection algorithms to determine shade coverage percentages for each route segment, enabling the routing system to weight pathways based on their shade coverage for optimal pedestrian comfort.
